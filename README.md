# Frontend Developer Test

Please create new php page from given mockup. Just a single landing page.

1. The mockup file is located on https://github.com/faridefendi58/additional-test/blob/master/assets/images/mockup.png. Or you can simply clone this github repository (https://github.com/faridefendi58/additional-test.git) into your local machine.
1. The main rule is please store the list of header menu, footer menu, phone number, and company address (https://prnt.sc/hmcavo) on a json file. https://prnt.sc/hmc6rj
So you just call the data from json file in order to make dinamic content and avoid many hardcoded content.
1. Feel free to use your favorite css framework, bootstrap, materialize css, and etc.
1. All the icons and the other images you need should be available on that github repository. https://github.com/faridefendi58/additional-test/tree/master/assets
1. We appreciate if you use the same fonts as the mockup needed. The fonts are located on https://github.com/faridefendi58/additional-test/tree/master/assets/fonts.
Please check our live page version (https://www.niagahoster.co.id) for the detail fonts style.
1. And then please integrate the free version of jivo chat (https://www.jivochat.com/) to your chat button https://prnt.sc/hmca5p.
You can make a free account there.
1. And for sure, take care of the mobile view. Make sure that your page not break on mobile device resolution. 

Finally, please give us your page on both preview url and link of your code repository.
Note : if you are familiar with twig (https://twig.symfony.com/), using twig on creating your preview page is much better.
